## MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION

This is a project to train deep convolutional neural nets to predict handwritten digits.
There are three models trained using keras, tensorflow and pytorch.
The dataset used is from the MNIST database.
Run digit_recogniser.py to get the GUI interface where you can draw digits and use any of the three models to recognize the digits. Use predict_best to get the most probable digit prediction.
